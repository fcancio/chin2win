Game description:
    'Chin 2 Win' is a fun game to play to show off your celebrity chin knowledge amongst friends. Or perhaps you'd like to just prove it to yourself.

How to play:
    Single Player/How many?: For each turn, an image of a celebrity's chin will be displayed on the screen. Player types out their best guess of the name of the celebrity whose chin is pictured. The player is allotted 1 incorrect guess pass each turn, which rolls over if not used. A player may also trade an incorrect guess pass for one clue about the celebrity.  Each game lasts 10 chins.

    Multiplayer/How fast?: Each player takes turns correctly typing the name of a celebrity whose chin is pictured. A player accumulates time for every second taken to answer correctly, with a time limit of 60 seconds (1 minute) for each turn. If a player is unable to correctly guess the name of the celebrity within the time limit, 120 seconds (2 minutes) will be added to their cumulative time.

How to win:
    Single player: Guess all 10 chins correctly!
    Multi player: Player with the least accumulated time wins!

Name rules:
    Spelling counts
    Casing does not matter
